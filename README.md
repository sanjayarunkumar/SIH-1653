## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
 AI-Powered Interview Panel:Uses AI & NLP to generate interview questions dynamically based on the candidateâ€™s profile.
AI evaluates responses in real-time and provides instant scoring based on relevance, depth, and technical accuracy.
Virtual Boardroom with Real-Time Analytics
Provides a real-life boardroom experience with interactive video/audio features.
Uses speech-to-text for response tracking and AI-driven sentiment analysis.
Gamified Skill Assessment
Instead of just answering questions, candidates solve real-world challenges or case studies.
Uses interactive simulations (coding, system design, problem-solving) to assess practical knowledge.
Smart Scoring & Adaptive Questioning
Uses AI-based adaptive testing, where difficulty adjusts based on candidate performance.
Experts receive a quantifiable score for the quality of their questions.
